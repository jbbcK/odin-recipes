        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Porto’s obsession with tripe stretches back to a legend from the 15th 
            century. At the time men were dreaming of remote and exotic lands to feed 
            their hunger for discovery. Infante Dom Henrique, the son of King João I, 
            was a great navigator. He set sail from Porto in 1415 with a fleet of dozens of 
            boats to conquer Ceuta, an autonomous Spanish city on the African coast of 
            the Mediterranean. Provisioning the boats for such an odyssey demanded 
            colossal effort. Locals wanted to help, so lambs, pigs, and oxen were killed, 
            quartered, cured, and packed in casks and boxes to be stored in the ship’s 
            hull. Every part of the animal was taken except for the tripe, which was left 
            behind because of its more perishable nature. Instead of throwing the 
            tripe away, locals invented a way of eating the leftovers. And so tripas à moda do Porto was born.

            <li>Whole or half chicken</li>
            <li>2 large onions</li>
            <li>2.2 pounds butter beans</li>
            <li>2 carrots, sliced</li>
            <li>1 Tbs lard</li>
            <li>Paprika, to taste</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 bunch parsley</li>
            <li>Olive oil, to taste (optional)</li>
            <li>Cumin, to taste</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation:</h2>
        <p><em>Every cook has their own process, but the main secret is assembling the recipe so that the flavors have time to breathe 
            and mingle with one another</em>.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the beans overnight.</li>
            <li>Rinse the tripe thoroughly, rubbing it with salt and lemon. Boil the tripe in a pot of salted water. Clean the calf’s head and cook it
                . In a different pot, boil the remaining meats and the chicken, which should be removed gradually as they become tender. 
                (Some people boil the meats the evening before they make the dish in order to improve the taste and make it easier to add on the 
                day of cooking.)</li>
            <li>Cut one onion into wedges. Cook it with the beans and carrots in a pan with water. Chop the other onion and brown it with the lard. 
                Add paprika and all the chopped meats. Leave it to soak a little bit.</li>
            <li>Add the beans and cook until they are tender. Season with salt and ground black pepper, bay leaf, and parsley and leave to simmer until 
                it has properly thickened. Add paprika as needed. (Some restaurants and family recipes add a drizzle of olive oil.)</li>
            <li>Remove the parsley and transfer to a porcelain or clay dish. Sprinkle to taste with cumin or chopped parsley and serve with white rice.</li>
        </ol>
